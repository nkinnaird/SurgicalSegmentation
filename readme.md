# Surgical Segmentation

**Work in progress.**


This is a toy project using a Kaggle dataset to do some segmentation on surgical images. Kaggle dataset used from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yjh4374/sisvse-dataset).

The code is at the moment a little messy, unfinished, and simplified compared to what I've done on before. This project is mostly an exercise in both reminding myself some of the techniques I used at SkinIO as a computer vision / machine learning engineer, and to have a small example to show interviewers. My [MangroveClassification](https://github.com/nkinnaird/MangroveClassification/tree/master) project is a little more fleshed-out, though it is also an earlier project from before I worked at SkinIO.


## Details

```
- train.py - Model training script.
- tf_data_utils.py - tf.data.Dataset implementation and utility file.
- model_utils.py - Model architecture implementation file.
- DataEDA.ipynb - Notebook to explore surgical dataset, and view trained model predictions.
```

The `DataEDA.ipynb` contains visualizations of model performance and comments related to next project steps for improved performance. 

Feel free to reach out to me for any questions, or if you'd like me to explain what I've done in this project.
