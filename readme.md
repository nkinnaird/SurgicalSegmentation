# Surgical Segmentation

**Work in progress.**


This is a toy project using a Kaggle dataset to do some segmentation on surgical images.
Kaggle dataset used from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yjh4374/sisvse-dataset).

The code is (at the moment) messy/unfinished and simplified compared to what I've done on before, and is mostly an exercise in both reminding myself some of the techniques I used at SkinIO as a computer vision / machine learning engineer, and to have a small example to show interviewers.

My [MangroveClassification](https://github.com/nkinnaird/MangroveClassification/tree/master) project is a little more fleshed-out, though it is also a simplified/earlier project. 

Feel free to reach out to me for any questions, or if you'd like me to explain what I've done in this project.
